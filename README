This is simple syntax checker for Extended Cisco ALCs.


Vladimir Kotal <vlada@devnull.cz>, 2004-2005


What is does
------------

It checks syntax of the following format:

access-list [list number] [permit | deny] [protocol] [source specification]
[destination specification] [protocol qualification] [logging]

list number - unsigned integer from 100 to 199
	      (maximum number of 100 ACLs on single router, huh)
permit|deny - 
protocol - protocol specification. ip, tcp, udp or icmp.
	   can be specified as protocol number (0, 6, 17, 1)

	   ah		51
	   eigrp	88
	   esp		50
	   gre		47
	   icmp		1
	   igmp		2
	   igrp		9
	   ip		0-255 (? XXX)
	   ipinip	94 
	   nos		4
	   ospf		89
	   tcp		6
	   udp		17
	   
source specification - [IP address] [wildcard mask] [port number specification]
			port number can be specified only for TCP or UDP
destination specification - the same as source specification
IP address - IPv4 or IPv6 address (without prefix ? XXX)
wildcard mask - bitmask for IP address (making network address from single
		IP address)
		IPv6 prefix ? XXX
port number specification - <eq number> | <range from to>
			    port number can be from 0 to 65536 XXX
			    from and to are non-inclusive XXX

			    TCP/UDP:

			    biff		512
			    bootpc		68
			    ... (XXX)
			    
protocol qualifiers - 
		     - for ICMP it is type and code values e.g.
		      3 4 (ICMP_UNREACH ICMP_UNREACH_NEEDFRAG) 
		      or just the type
		      17 (ICMP_MASKREQ)
		      or it can be written as echo, echo-reply etc.

			administratively-prohibited
			alternate-address
			conversion-error
			dod-host-prohibited
			dod-net-prohibited
			echo
			echo-reply
			general-parameter-problem
			host-isolated
			mobile-redirect
			net-redirect
			net-tos-redirect
			net-unreachable
			network-unknown
			no-room-for-option
			option-missing
			packet-too-big
			parameter-problem
			port-unreachable
			precedence-unreachable
			protocol-unreachable
			host-precedence-unreachable
			host-redirect host-tos-redirect
			host-unknown
			host-unreachable
			information-reply
			information-request
			mask-reply
			mask-request
			reassemble-timeout
			redirect
			router-advertisement
			router-solicitation
			source-quench
			source-route-failed
			time-exceeded
			timestamp-reply
			timestamp-request
			traceroute
			ttl-exceeded
			unreachable

		      
		     - for TCP it can be 'established' keyword
		       which matches TCP packets with ACK bit set
logging - keyword, log every packet matching rule contaning this keyword
	  this keyword can be abbreviated to 'log'.
	  this is for extended ACLs only !

Examples
--------

Some Cisco extended ACL examples:

access-list 129  permit udp host 195.56.57.153  195.49.50.0 0.0.0.255 eq snmp
access-list 129  deny   ip 195.81.82.0 0.0.0.255  any log
access-list 130  permit icmp any 195.13.14.0 0.0.0.255  3 13 !  administratively-prohibited
